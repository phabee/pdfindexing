# Make pdfs searchable
I recently joined a course on data analysis and got tons of hi-quality but non-searchable pdfs. This is especially annoying, when you have to find information you know having read, but don't exactly remember the exact wording. You then have no other way than visually scan through every single page to identify the exact location.
Motivated by this pain, I started to find a batch-able solution to solve this issue and to make it available and hopefully reduce other people's pain, I'll provide the solution here.

# Dependencies
Version 0.1.4 of pdfsandwich, a wrapper script using other tools to perform certain tasks. Please refer to Tobias Elze's Website 'http://www.tobias-elze.de/pdfsandwich/' for further information.

# System Requirements
I developed it on a Linux Mint 17 Qiana distribution, x86_64. 

# License
The script is open source (license is GPL).
